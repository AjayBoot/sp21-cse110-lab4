1. The bug is that the program is adding the inputs as strings as opposed to doing numeric addition. This results in the numbers just being combined as a string instead of actually being added together.

2. I would fix it by converting the strings to ints before passing it into the function. I did so by adding the parseInt function, as shown [here](./part1problem2fix.png).
